# University-Grades-Calculator-Py
It was a project in my COMP-6411 course. 
<p>It calculates grades providing marks obtained in all assignments, projects and all tests. It is robust enough to handle errors or missing entries in student data(may be student is absent etc.). Also, you can provide any number as class average and grades will be calculated accordingly.<p/>
